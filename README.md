# Crowdwall_Ibercivis

Crowdwall is an APP and Website designed to provide the user with information on fire risk. To do this, it communicates
directly with VIIRS and MODIS data repositories that provide data on active fires, and combines them with data 
such as wind direction, temperature, cloudiness rate, rainfall provided by openweather.

All this is presented on a map where, in addition, the user can issue his own alerts: active fires, smoke detection 
and distress call.

Designed to be used as a "social network" in areas with fire hazards, Crowdwall offers information to the user to 
make him feel safe and accompanied.


You can test the backend in:

The app is available at play store:

Openwather integration is based on
https://github.com/buche/leaflet-openweathermap

There are two main components in this repository, the android app and the web site app (in two different folders)

This app has been build under the "EOVALUE apps for environmental and social change" program.
